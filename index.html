  <p>I got my inspiration from the splendid natural phenomenon, which has an extremely romantic name: blue tears. It occurs particularly in bays and coastal areas, when certain types of microorganisms in the water emit a blueish glow when disturbed by movement or waves, creating a stunning visual display of blue light at night.</p>
